# budgetoffline
## Description
I have modified this budget tracker so that it is able to input transactions while the user does not have an internet connection. Following reestablishment of an internet connection the offline transactions will be added to the application's database.

## Installation
This program can be run by navigating to the parent directory and running the command NPM Start and opening the application on the browser of your choice. If you would like to open the application in a development environment you can clone it from the [following location](https://github.com Jsegel9/budgetoffline)

## Usage
Using the app is very straightforward, simply enter your name and the amount of your transaction and it will be reflected in your balance and in the graph. In order to make sure the application runs at it's optimal performance please clear your cache before using the app for the first time.
